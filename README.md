# Banking Digitalization using Hybrid Cloud with IBM Z.

The following journey will introduce the available Banking APIs published on IBM Cloud with logical business programs running on the IBM Z mainframe through a simulated retail bank called MPLbank.

# MPLbank

## Architecture

This journey accesses a fictitious retail banking system called MPLbank. MPLbank integrates an Account Management System, a Payment Hub (not shown in the schema), a Customer Management System and a Financial Risk Management System. On top of these components, an API layer hosted in IBM Cloud has been set up to deliver a banking API, and make them reachable from all kind of applications.

![alt text](images/architecture.png "Architecture")

Published banking API includes:
* **/customers/** operation path calls the Customer Database services in MPLbank.
* **/accounts/** operation path calls the Account Management System services in MPLbank.
* **/customers/loan/** operation path calls the Financial Risk Management System service in MPLbank.

The Customer Database System and Financial Risk Management System expose services through built-in REST/JSON interfaces. In front of the Account Management System, IBM z/OS Connect EE has been set up to create REST/JSON Interfaces from COBOL programs running in CICS. As a result, these 3 sub-systems are flexible and reachable using REST/JSON APIs. These sub-systems act as micro-services by delivering REST/JSON interfaces and IBM API Connect acts as an API layer to manage a unique and final set of banking REST/JSON APIs. The resulting hybrid architecture approach enables the best of both worlds and builds a fast and secure API Economy.

    * The right panel contains sample code in various programming languages.
    
2.	Discover the operation **GET /customers/{customerID}** by reading its documentation.
	![alt text](images/bankingAPICustomer.png "Banking APIs")
	* Click **GET /customers/{customerID}**.
    
    This operation gives personal data relative to a banking customer. All available customers ID are in the */identifier/customerIDs.txt* file in this Github repository.
    
3.	Generate code for the operation **GET /customers/{customerID}** following the right panel of this operation.
	![alt text](images/curlRequest.png "Test the API")
	* Click a programming language that you want to work with.
    
   	Sample code for the selected programming language and an example output of a successful response are displayed. You can copy the code and use it in your own application.
  
4. 	Test the operation **GET /customers/{customerID}** in your programming language.
   	
   	![alt text](images/curlRequest2.png "Test the API")
	* Scroll down to the **Try this operation** section.
	
	> IMPORTANT: All available customers ID are in the */identifier/customerIDs.txt* file in this Github repository. Do not forget to fill the *x-ibm-client-id* and *x-ibm-client-secret* with yours.

   	* Click **Call Operation**.
 	
 	You should see the returned output at the bottom of the page.  	
 	
 	![alt text](images/curlResponse.png "API Response")

# Part B: Make your own banking application

A quick banking application has been developed in order to help you to start coding. This web application (HTML/CSS/Javascript) uses the banking API introduced before. 

## 1. Download and review the banking application code

1.	Download and import the project *bankingApplication* located in **this Github repository** into your preferred IDE like Eclipse.
	![alt text](images/bankingClone.png "Download the application")
	* Either click on **Download ZIP**
	* Or use Git Command : 
	>	git clone https://github.com/IBM/banking-digitalization-using-hybrid-cloud-with-mainframes.git
	
2.	Review the *index.html* file in order to understand how it is working.

3.	Review the *bankingAPI.js* file in order to understand how the script works.
	![alt text](images/bankingCodeJS.png "JS Code")
	* Change the customer ID if needed. It has been hardcoded for this sample code. 
	> NOTE: You can change the customer identifier through the *identifier* folder in this Github repository. 1000 customers have been generated, meaning it represents 1000 different banking customers.
	* Replace **IBM_CLIENT_ID** and **IBM_CLIENT_SECRET** variables by yours and save the file.
	
## 2. Run the banking application
	
1.	Open the *index.html* in your favorite web browser. The application will automatically run.
	>	NOTE: There is no need to compile JS/HTML/CSS from any IDE! Just edit those files in the IDE and refresh the *index.html* in the web browser (or Ctrl + F5 shortcut key) to reload this web application. 

	![alt text](images/banking_application.png "Banking Application Sample")
	
2.	Click on the button **Click here to load a banking customer profile**. 
	![alt text](images/banking_application_result.png "Banking Application Sample")
	
	This will call the published operation **GET /customer/{customerID}**. 
	
3. 	Understand the output JSON response from this operation call.

4.	Call each other services in the sample banking application. Each service matches a published banking operation:
	* 	**Customer contract**
	*	**Banking Account - Balance Inquiry**
	*	**Banking Account - Transaction Inquiry**
	*	**Banking Account - Detail**
